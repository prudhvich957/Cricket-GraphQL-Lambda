# Node/Express GraphQL API on AWS Lambda for a Sample Cricket Matches Database
This project is built with Express as the foundation, and the GraphQL APIs are built on top
using the apt. packages (express-graphql, graphql). MongoDb is used as the NoSql DB.
Finally, the serverless framework is used to direcltly deploy to AWS Lambda


The aritecture is simple and distinct:
 - src/config - Database Connection and setup
 - src/model - Mongoose Model
 - src/schema - All GraphQL Code
 - src/server.js - Express App Code

# Available Routes

 - "/" - A simple JSON response containing all the data for reference
 - "/graphql" - The graphQl editor to run all the available GraphQL API.
